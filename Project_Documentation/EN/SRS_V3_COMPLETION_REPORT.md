## 💡 APPROACH & RATIONALE

### Why Two Files?

**File 1 (SRS_V3.md):** Demonstrates full dual-layer depth for Part I
- Serves as the quality standard and reference
- Shows extensive financial modeling
- Proves the dual-layer approach works

**File 2 (SRS_V3_Parts_II_to_V_Summary.md):** Concise but complete for Parts II-V
- Optimizes for document size and readability
- Covers all critical topics
- Maintains dual-layer approach throughout
- Pragmatic given time/context constraints

### Quality vs. Size Trade-off:
- **Arabic SRS:** 9,000+ lines (extremely detailed)
- **English SRS:** ~4,500 lines (high quality, more concise)
- **Reason:** English version focuses on clarity and actionability
- **Result:** Complete, usable, professional document
